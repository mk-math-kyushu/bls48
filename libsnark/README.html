<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>BLS48 is an Optimal Ate Pairing(OAP) on BLS Curve implementation in C++.
This implementation is based on the drafts below;</p>
<ul>
<li>Y. Kiyomura, et al. "Secure and Eifficient Apiaring at 256-Bit Secure Level" (2017)</li>
<li>C. Costello, K. Lauter, M. Naehrig, "Attractive Subfamilies of BLS Curves for Implementing High-Security Pairings." (2011)</li>
<li>draft-by-Kato(not submitted)</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, this implementation uses libsnark library.
- https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/tree/deprecated-master  (branch : deprecated-master)</p>
<p>We are motivated by the security consideration for pairing on any curve give by T. Kim.
- T. Kim et al. "The extended tower number field sieve: A new complexity for the medium prime case. In Advances in Cryptology", (2016).</p>
<p>Kim's attack made us to update the security parameters or to use alternative curves in OAP.
BLS-48 cuerve is one of the pairing friendly curves, and recommended parameters for realizing 256-bit security is written in [Kiyomura].</p>

<h2 id="build-instructions">Build instructions</h2>
<p>This implementation relies on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>C++ build environment</li>
<li>GMP for certain bit-integer arithmetic</li>
<li>libprocps for reporting memory usage</li>
<li>GTest for some of the unit tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We have tested these only Linux so far(Ubuntu14.04).
For example, on a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04, install the following packages:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential git libgmp3-dev libprocps3-dev libgtest-dev python-markdown libboost-all-dev libssl-dev</p>
<p>Then, to compile, run:
$ make</p>
